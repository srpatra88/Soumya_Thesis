This folder contains the outputs of the entity extraction experiments on Ritter et al. test dataset.

Every line in the output files contains a test tweet and the extracted mentions. Tweet and mentions are separated by tabs. 
In a mention list, mentions are separated by '||'. In our approach there is also a third tab displaying the disambiguations of the mentions.
