This folder contains the outputs of the experiments conducted on Ritter et al. dataset for the evaluation of the importance of each step. Our_output_complete.txt contains the result of our complete system. The other files show the results after removing one step from the pipeline.

Every line in the output files contains a test tweet, the extracted list of mentions and the disambiguated entities separated by tabs. Below, we show an example of the output. In a mention list, mentions are separated by '||'.
